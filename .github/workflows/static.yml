      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my website.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™m Manish Vaishnav, a finance professional with over two decades of experience in managing financial operations, leading teams, and driving strategic initiatives across diverse industries. Currently serving as Director of Finance & Administration at a technology-driven company in Singapore, I have built my career on strong financial acumen, hands-on leadership, and a deep understanding of international financial reporting standards (IFRS).</p>
      <p>But beyond the spreadsheets and boardrooms, Iâ€™m also a family man, a lifelong learner, and someone who strongly believes in living by values.</p>
      <p>Integrity and honesty are the core principles I live by â€” even when it's inconvenient. I believe in helping others whenever I can, practicing compassion in all interactions, and staying grounded no matter how busy life gets. These values not only guide my professional conduct but also shape how I raise my daughter, how I relate to my colleagues, and how I contribute to my community.</p>
      <p>Learning is a continuous journey for me. Iâ€™m deeply curious about a wide range of subjects beyond finance â€” from <strong>spirituality, psychology, and neuroscience</strong> to <strong>technology, artificial intelligence, and data analytics</strong>. Iâ€™m fascinated by how these disciplines intersect and influence the way we live, work, and think.</p>
      <p>This website is a small step towards sharing ideas, connecting with like-minded individuals, and giving back through the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained over the years.</p>
      <p>Thank you for stopping by â€” I hope something here inspires, informs, or connects with you.</p>

      <p><strong>Building Resilience: Key Lessons from Harvard Business Reviewâ€™s Emotional Intelligence Series</strong></p>
      <p>In this blog post, I reflect on the powerful lessons from the Harvard Business Reviewâ€™s Emotional Intelligence Series, particularly focusing on the theme of resilience. Itâ€™s a topic close to my heart, both as a leader and as a lifelong learner navigating the challenges of a dynamic world.</p>
      <p>From recognizing emotions and staying calm in adversity to building supportive networks and reframing setbacks â€” this post is about actionable strategies that can help professionals at all levels grow stronger, mentally and emotionally.</p>
